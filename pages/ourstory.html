            <p id="start">There is nothing more exciting than tasting the first dash of a new hot sauce. That is why we
                here at
                <em>Ghost</em> strive for the absolute best in everything we do.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p> From humble beginnings in kitchens across the mid-west, our team of Chefs always sought after the
                freshest and finest ingredients.
                What they discovered is that through the careful cultivation and extraction of these amazing
                ingredients, you can create an <em>experience</em>.
                The team at <em>Ghost</em> has carefully crafted that experience from farm to table, in a unique and
                exhiliarating product line which has taken a decade to develop, test, and perfect.
                From it's origins in 2010 at the Lackluster Pepper Farm here in Ohio, to the worldwide phenomenon it is
                today, <em>Ghost</em> has always had one belief.</p>
            <p><strong>First Impressions</strong> really matter.</p>
            <p>So we cultivate the very best experience with each and every bottle of our sauce.
                This process is guaranteed by our Mission Statement:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Always use the freshest ingredients available.</li>
                <li>Never settle for second best.</li>
                <li>Occasionally, stop to appreciate what you've made.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Started by a handful of the mid-wests <em>best</em> Chefs, we are excited to introduce you to the new
                website,
                for one of the finest hotsauce brands, known the world over, as <em>Ghost</em>.</p>
            <hr>
            <p> Started in 2010 by Chefs Tom L'Orange, Orville Vimy, and Michel Cot√©, <em>Ghost</em>
                Developed first as a hobby and a passion for three upcoming chefs who enjoyed cultivating strong Bhut
                Jolokia, or Ghost Pepper Chili's.</p>
            <p>From there, they formed a co-operative greenhouse with several other local farmers and growers of hot
                house tomatoes, zucchini, various bean varietals, and more.</p>
            <p>After seeing what their colleagues, friends, and patrons were saying about the quality of their peppers,
                Tom, Orville, and Michel devised a plan to take
                their fledgling interest to a whole new level. <em>Ghost</em> was born.</p>
            <p class="blockquote">

                We always knew we had something really special, and we wanted to bring our hard work and new spin on
                things to the masses.
                It was never about getting to that 'big business' level for us, it was always just about delivering the
                very best experience we could to as many people as would try us out.
            </p>
            <p class="blockquote-footer"> Tom L'Orange, Co-Founder of <em>Ghost</em></p>
            <p>What happened next can only be described as gruelling, as Tom, Orville, and Michel spent nearly ten years in the process of
                testing, tuning, perfecting, and finally delivering what has come to be known as one of the world's finest Hot Sauces.</p>
            <p>In 2020, we welcome you to the new online home and storefront of <em>Ghost</em>. Now, in Glorious Web 2.0!</p>
